# Behavioral Systems Repository

Applied behavioral tooling built to regulate attention, timing, and execution reliability in demanding operational environments.

---

## What This Repository Is
This collection focuses on human-performance instrumentation rather than data analytics.  
Each application acts as a behavioral feedback device that helps users see, measure, and correct their own working patterns in real time.

---

## Why It Exists
Most productivity failures are not skill problems — they are visibility problems.

These systems solve that by exposing hidden variables such as:
• time drift
• attention decay
• schedule deviation
• execution lag

Once visible, behavior becomes adjustable.

---

## Functional Capabilities
• Real-time focus monitoring  
• Schedule adherence detection  
• Pattern-based behavioral feedback  
• Reinforcement-driven productivity loops  
• Execution consistency tracking  

---

## Included Application Types
• Focus regulation timers  
• Adherence monitoring dashboards  
• Execution tracking interfaces  
• Reinforcement-driven workflow tools  

---

## Design Model
All tools follow the same behavioral control cycle:

signal → awareness → correction → stabilization

---

## Engineering Constraints
• Runs entirely client-side  
• No server dependency  
• Instant feedback priority  
• Works in restricted environments  
• Deterministic logic before AI assistance  

---

## Technology Foundation
Vanilla JavaScript • Canvas API • Notification API • Tailwind CSS

---

## Repository Intent
This repository represents practical behavioral engineering applied to real work environments where performance is determined not by knowledge, but by execution discipline.
